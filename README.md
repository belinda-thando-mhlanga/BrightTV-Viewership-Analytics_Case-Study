Bright TV Analysis Case Study

# 🔍 How the Case Study qa conducted:
The analysis was performed by importing the dataset into a BI/SQL environment, summarising viewer counts by demographic factors, and creating pivot tables to uncover patterns. Viewer distribution was analysed across:

- Gender (Male, Female, Unknown)
- Monthly viewer counts (Jan, Feb, Mar)
- Hours watched (0–3 hrs, 3–6 hrs, 6–9 hrs, 9–12 hrs)
- Cross-analysis (Gender × Hours watched)
These summaries helped identify key trends, such as which gender group watches the most content and how engagement hours differ.

# 📊 Insights Found
The total number of viewers analysed was 9,995, showing strong engagement.
Male viewers dominate the platform with 8,757 viewers, significantly higher than female viewers.
Most viewers (9,969) watch between 0–3 hours, showing that short-duration engagement is the main consumption pattern.
Very few viewers watch more than 3 hours, indicating opportunities for retention or longer-format content.
Monthly data shows a steady rise over the first quarter, with March having the highest viewership.
